2. Click on "Download R for Windows"
3. Click on "base"
4. Click on the download link for the latest version (e.g., "Download R-4.x.x for Windows")
5. Run the downloaded installer and follow the prompts
   - Accept default settings or customize as needed
   - Note installation location

#### macOS

1. Go to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. Click on "Download R for macOS"
3. Download the latest .pkg file for the system
4. Open the downloaded file and follow installation instructions

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

1. Open a terminal window
2. Update your system's package index:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
3. Install R:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install r-base
   ```

### Installing RStudio

After installing R, install RStudio:

2. Download the installer for the operating system
3. Run the installer and follow prompts

## Verification

To verify installation:

1. Open RStudio
2. In the Console, type:
   ```r
   R.version
   ```
3. Press Enter to display R installation information

## Package Installation

Install packages using:

```r
install.packages("packagename")
```

Example - tidyverse installation:
```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

### Essential Packages

Recommended packages for beginners:

```r
install.packages("dplyr")      # Data manipulation and visualization
install.packages("rmarkdown")  # Dynamic documents
install.packages("knitr")      # Report generation
install.packages("shiny")      # Interactive web applications
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues on Windows

- **Permission errors**: Run RStudio as administrator
- **Path too long errors**: Install R in a directory with a shorter path

### Common Issues on macOS

- **Package installation failures**: Install development tools:
  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

### Common Issues on Linux

- **Missing dependencies**: Install R dependencies:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev
  ```
