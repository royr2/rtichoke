## Run R Code in the Browser - No Installation Required

The WebR Playground allows users to write and execute R code directly in their browser. This feature is ideal for beginners wanting to experiment with R or for quick code testing when away from the main development environment.

## What is WebR?

[WebR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) is a version of R compiled to WebAssembly, enabling R code execution directly in web browsers. This provides:

- No installation required
- Instant access to R functionality
- Code execution on any device with a modern browser

## Using the WebR Playground

::: {.callout-note}
## Current Limitations

Please note that this basic implementation has some limitations:

- No plotting capability is available
- Package installation is not supported
- Only basic R functionality is available

For full R functionality, RStudio or other complete R environments are recommended.

## Example Code for Practice

The following simple R code examples can be tested in the WebR Playground:

### Basic Calculations

```r
# Basic arithmetic
2 + 2 * 5
sqrt(16)
log(10)

# Create and manipulate vectors
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(x)
sd(x)
sum(x)
```

### Data Analysis

```r
# Create some sample data
x <- 1:10
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 7, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)

# Print the data
cat("x values:", x, "\n")
cat("y values:", y, "\n")

# Calculate some statistics
mean_x <- mean(x)
mean_y <- mean(y)
cat("Mean of x:", mean_x, "\n")
cat("Mean of y:", mean_y, "\n")

# Fit a linear model
model <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(model)
```

### Working with Built-in Datasets

```r
# Explore the built-in mtcars dataset
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
summary(mtcars)

# Basic statistics
cor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)
t.test(mtcars$mpg[mtcars$am == 0], mtcars$mpg[mtcars$am == 1])
```

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for basic plotting
2. Access to more packages
3. Ability to save and share code snippets
