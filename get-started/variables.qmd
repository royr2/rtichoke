## Creating Variables in R

Variables in R are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout your code. Here's how to create and work with variables:

### Basic Assignment

```{r}
# Using the assignment operator (<-)
x <- 10
y <- "Hello, R!"
z <- TRUE

# Print the variables
x
y
z
```

### Alternative Assignment Methods

```{r}
# Using the equals sign (=)
age = 25

# Using the assignment operator in reverse (->)
"Data Scientist" -> job_title

# Print the variables
age
job_title
```

### Variable Naming Rules

-   Names can contain letters, numbers, dots (.) and underscores (\_)
-   Names must start with a letter or a dot
-   If a name starts with a dot, it cannot be followed by a number
-   Names are case-sensitive (`Value` and `value` are different variables)

```{r}
# Valid variable names
valid_name <- 1
validName <- 2
valid.name <- 3
.hidden <- 4

# Print variables
valid_name
validName
valid.name
.hidden
```

### Data Types

R has several basic data types:

```{r}
# Numeric
num <- 42.5
typeof(num)

# Integer (note the L suffix)
int <- 42L
typeof(int)

# Character
text <- "R programming"
typeof(text)

# Logical
flag <- TRUE
typeof(flag)
```

### Checking and Converting Types

```{r}
# Check if a variable is of a specific type
is.numeric(num)
is.character(text)

# Convert between types
as.character(num)
as.numeric("100")
as.logical(1)
```

### Variable Information

```{r}
# Get information about a variable
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
class(x)
length(x)
str(x)
```

Remember that R is dynamically typed, so variables can change types during execution. This flexibility is one of R's strengths for data analysis.
